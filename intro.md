# Streams in NodeJS

> Almost all Node.js programs, no matter how simple, use Streams in some way.

## There are essentially three major concepts:

- **source** - where the data comes from
- **pipeline** - where you filter or transform your data as it passes through
- **sink** - where your data ultimately goes


## Benefits in using streams:

- **lazily produce or consume** data in buffered chunks
- **low memory footprint**
- evented and non-blocking
- automatically handle back-pressure
